# FactoryBot Factories
#
# Define your factories here for creating test data
# Example:
#
# FactoryBot.define do
#   factory :user do
#     name { Faker::Name.name }
#     email { Faker::Internet.email }
#     age { Faker::Number.between(from: 18, to: 80) }
#   end
# end
#
# Usage in specs:
#   user = create(:user)               # Persisted to database
#   user = build(:user)                # Not persisted
#   user = build_stubbed(:user)        # Stubbed, faster
